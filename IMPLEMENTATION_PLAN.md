# Kingston Event Permit Pre-Checker - Implementation Plan

## Context

Small event organizers in Kingston (students, nonprofits, first-timers) struggle with the permit application process because requirements change based on location, size, alcohol, noise, and other factors. City staff spend excessive time answering repetitive questions and reviewing incomplete applications.

**Solution**: An adaptive permit pre-checker that asks 8-12 smart questions, auto-generates a checklist of required permits with timelines and contacts, and flags missing information before submission. This is "TurboTax for city permits" - translating complex rules into an understandable system.

**Target**: QHacks hackathon (~36 hours), 4-person team, React/Next.js + TypeScript stack, production-ready polish focus.

---

## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Context or Zustand (for form state)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Deployment**: Vercel (instant, free for hackathons)

**Why this stack**:
- Fast development velocity
- Professional UI out of the box
- No backend infrastructure needed initially
- Easy to add API routes if time permits
- Excellent for demos

---

## Core Features (Priority Order)

### ✅ Phase 1: Must-Have (Core Demo) - Hours 0-20

#### 1. Smart Questionnaire Flow
**Owner: Frontend Dev**

Multi-step wizard that asks contextual questions:
- Event basics (name, description)
- Location (dropdown of Kingston parks/venues OR address input)
- Date and time (with duration)
- Estimated attendance
- Event type checkboxes (alcohol, food, amplified sound, vendor booths)
- Road/sidewalk impact
- Organization type (student/nonprofit/for-profit)

**Technical approach**:
- React Hook Form for form management
- Conditional question rendering (e.g., if alcohol=yes, ask about liquor license)
- Progress indicator
- Clean, accessible UI using shadcn/ui components

**Validation**:
- Zod schemas for each step
- Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- "Previous" and "Next" navigation

#### 2. Rules Engine
**Owner: Rules Engine Dev**

Decision logic that maps answers to required permits:

```typescript
interface EventInput {
  location: string;
  attendance: number;
  hasAlcohol: boolean;
  hasFood: boolean;
  hasAmplifiedSound: boolean;
  hasRoadClosure: boolean;
  duration: number;
  isForProfit: boolean;
  // ... other fields
}

interface PermitRequirement {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  department: string;
  contactEmail: string;
  contactPhone: string;
  timeline: number; // days before event
  cost: number | "varies";
  requiredDocuments: string[];
  reasoning: string; // why this permit is required
}
```

**Rules logic** (simplified but authentic Kingston requirements):

1. **Special Event Permit**
   - IF: attendance > 50 OR hasAlcohol OR hasRoadClosure
   - Timeline: 14 days before
   - Cost: $100-$300

2. **Noise Exemption**
   - IF: hasAmplifiedSound AND (time after 9pm OR time before 7am)
   - Timeline: 10 days before
   - Cost: $75

3. **Parks Booking**
   - IF: location is a city park
   - Timeline: 7 days before
   - Cost: $50-$200

4. **Liquor License / Special Occasion Permit**
   - IF: hasAlcohol
   - Timeline: 21 days before
   - Cost: $80 (AGCO fee)

5. **Certificate of Insurance**
   - IF: attendance > 100 OR hasAlcohol OR city park
   - Required: $2M liability coverage
   - Timeline: Submit with application

6. **Food Vendor Permit**
   - IF: hasFood
   - Contact: Kingston Health Unit
   - Timeline: 7 days before

7. **Road Closure Permit**
   - IF: hasRoadClosure
   - Timeline: 30 days before
   - Cost: $200+

**Implementation**:
- Pure function: `determinePermits(input: EventInput): PermitRequirement[]`
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Detailed reasoning for each permit (shown to user)

#### 3. Results & Checklist Page
**Owner: Frontend Dev**

Clean display of all required permits with:
- **Summary card**: "Your event requires X permits"
- **Timeline warning**: Flag if submitted too close to event date
- **Permit cards**: Each showing:
  - Name and description
  - Department contact
  - Deadline (calculated from event date)
  - Required documents
  - Why it's needed (reasoning)
- **Downloadable checklist**: Print-friendly version
- **Next steps**: Instructions on how to proceed

**Design notes**:
- Color-coded by urgency (red if deadline tight, yellow if moderate, green if plenty of time)
- Mobile-responsive
- Shareable link (encode answers in URL params)

#### 4. Kingston Permit Data Configuration
**Owner: Data/Research Person**

Research actual Kingston permit requirements and create:

```typescript
// config/permits.ts
export const PERMIT_CATALOG = {
  specialEvent: { /* ... */ },
  noiseExemption: { /* ... */ },
  // ... etc
};

// config/locations.ts
export const KINGSTON_VENUES = [
  { id: 'city-park', name: 'City Park', type: 'park', requiresBooking: true },
  { id: 'springer-market', name: 'Springer Market Square', type: 'square' },
  // ... real Kingston locations
];
```

**Research sources**:
- Kingston.ca official permit pages
- City bylaws (noise, parks, alcohol)
- AGCO regulations
- Insurance requirements from actual event applications

**Deliverable**: Well-documented config files with citations

---

### ⭐ Phase 2: Should-Have (If Time) - Hours 20-30

#### 5. Pre-Submission Validation
**Owner: Rules Engine Dev**

Before showing results, check for:
- **Missing information**: "You selected alcohol but didn't specify licensed server"
- **Timeline conflicts**: "Your event is in 8 days, but Special Event Permit needs 14 days"
- **Document reminders**: "Don't forget: insurance must be submitted with application"

Display warnings prominently before results page.

#### 6. Downloadable Output
**Owner: Integration Dev**

Generate a PDF or formatted document:
- Cover page with event details
- Permit checklist with checkboxes
- Contact information for each department
- Document submission checklist
- Timeline calendar view

**Tech**: Use `react-pdf` or `jspdf` or simple "print" CSS styling

#### 7. Admin Rule Configuration (Basic)
**Owner: Integration Dev**

Simple JSON editor or form to let "city staff" update rules without code:
- Add/edit permits
- Modify thresholds (attendance numbers, timelines)
- Update contact info

**Implementation**: Protected route with basic auth, form that edits JSON config

---

### 🚀 Phase 3: Nice-to-Have (Stretch) - Hours 30-36

#### 8. Save & Resume
- Store form state in localStorage or URL params
- "Email me this checklist" button

#### 9. Analytics Dashboard (Admin View)
- Most common event types
- Most frequently required permits
- Average completion time

#### 10. Multi-language Support
- French translations (Kingston is bilingual Ontario)
- Simple i18n setup

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Rules engine too complex
- **Mitigation**: Start with 4-5 permits, add more if time allows

**Risk**: Kingston data hard to research
- **Mitigation**: Use publicly available info, clearly note assumptions

**Risk**: UI takes too long
- **Mitigation**: Use shadcn/ui components out of the box, minimal custom styling

**Risk**: Team coordination issues
- **Mitigation**: Clear file ownership, Git branches per feature, integration checkpoints

---

## Success Metrics

**Minimum Viable Demo** (by Hour 24):
- ✅ Questionnaire works end-to-end
- ✅ Rules engine determines at least 4 permits correctly
- ✅ Results page displays cleanly
- ✅ Deployed and accessible

**Polished Demo** (by Hour 36):
- ✅ All 7 core permits implemented
- ✅ Timeline warnings work
- ✅ Professional styling throughout
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Downloadable checklist
- ✅ Demo script rehearsed

---

Ideas to mention in presentation:
- Connect directly to city permitting system API
- Analytics dashboard for city staff
- Risk scoring for internal use
- Template library for common events
- Integration with payment processing
- Automated reminder emails for deadlines
- Multi-city support

**Key message**: "This is designed to be production-ready, not just a demo."

---
